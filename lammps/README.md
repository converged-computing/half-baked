# Half Baked LAMMPS

Let's build the half baked image, manually first. This is going to use [llvm-ir-cmake-utils](https://github.com/compor/llvm-ir-cmake-utils).

```bash
docker build -t half-baked-lammps .
```

Eww, what? Who eats lammps?

Note that I see the "LLVM IR Utils" in the cmake configuration:

We will likely want some derivative of this akin to how we did pi (TBA).

```bash
for filename in $(ls *.ll); do
    llc -filetype=obj -O0 --relocation-model=pic --runtime-counter-relocation --relax-elf-relocations  $filename -o $filename.o
done
clang -shared -lstdc++ -lmpi -lmpi_cxx -lm *.o -o lammps.so
cp lammps.so /usr/lib/liblammps.so
```

And for the lmp executable:

```bash
llc -filetype=obj -O0 --relocation-model=pic --runtime-counter-relocation --relax-elf-relocations main.cpp.bc -o lmp.o
clang -lstdc++ -lmpi -lmpi_cxx -lm -llammps lmp.o -o lmp
```

Did it work?

```bash
cp lmp /usr/local/bin/half-baked-lmp
cd /opt/lammps/examples/reaxff/HNS/

half-baked-lmp -v x 2 -v y 2 -v z 2 -in ./in.reaxc.hns -nocite
```

Note that these are the relocation methods. There are a LOT of options for llc (we should look at them together).

This is awesome. I can't even right now.


## Kubernetes

Let's now create a small cluster and run the flux operator to run a pre-command to compile the IR.
  
```bash
GOOGLE_PROJECT=myproject
gcloud container clusters create test-cluster \
    --threads-per-core=1 \
    --placement-type=COMPACT \
    --num-nodes=5 \
    --region=us-central1-a \
    --project=${GOOGLE_PROJECT} \
    --machine-type=c2d-standard-8

    --network-performance-configs=total-egress-bandwidth-tier=TIER_1 \
    --enable-gvnic \
    --network=mtu9k
```

## Flux Operator

When the cluster is ready, install the Flux Operator from the development branch.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/test-refactor-modular/examples/dist/flux-operator-refactor.yaml
```

You can check logs to ensure it is also running, in the `operator-system` namespace.
We can use the deployed container [here](https://github.com/converged-computing/half-baked/pkgs/container/half-baked/181494855?tag=lammps-test-feb-20-2024).
Now run the minicluster. If you set interactive to true you can shell in to poke around.

```bash
kubectl apply -f minicluster.yaml
```

Wait for it to be running:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
half-baked-lammps-0-jtj2w   0/1     Init:0/1   0          16s
half-baked-lammps-1-vk6jp   0/1     Init:0/1   0          16s
half-baked-lammps-2-62gfk   0/1     Init:0/1   0          15s
half-baked-lammps-3-lkhvw   0/1     Init:0/1   0          15s
```

Note that the pre block will finish the compile and give you the total time to do that. The main command is then to run the "half-baked-lmp." Here is what the log looks like:

In the above, the extra compile time was 33 seconds, which (in retrospect) is a lot. The job is also about 30 seconds. You can thus imagine an experiment to try doing this on different node types, and comparing the total run time (to finish compiling) with the runtime of lammps, as compared to "if we didn't do anything case" (which we haven't defined yet). Here is what we see in the logs:

## Experiment Planning

### Prep Work

- **Prepare a base case** We likely want to build the "base case" that will have one LAMMPS time for comparison (without any pre-baked prep)
- **Choose nodes / instance architectures** We then want to chose some number of nodes to deploy to a GKE cluster. If it's annoying, it might make sense to just deploy N different clusters, and run some number of iterations for each with the setup. LAMMPS needs >1 node anyway, and we don't care about performance of LAMMPS, just relative times.

### Procedure 

Here is my idea for the experiment:

1. For each of the base case and instance architecture (list):
  1. Bring up a cluster of size N.
  1. Run M iterations of the half baked setup. The log should have the time for LAMMPS and the compile time
1. Parse results and compare the overall times - what is the tradeoff between the optimization and speedup from it?

We are going to need to be careful about instances / sizes because of GCP networking (which isn't very good) we might not have reasonably running lammps times. If this first run works OK, we can likely do one or two more apps and then write up the small study, probably to present the idea somewhere for fun.

### Clean Up

When you are done:

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete test-cluster --region=us-central1-a
```
